# NAME

osmium-time-filter - filter OSM data by time from a history file


# SYNOPSIS

**osmium time-filter** \[*OPTIONS*\] *OSM-HISTORY-FILE* \[*TIME*\]\
**osmium time-filter** \[*OPTIONS*\] *OSM-HISTORY-FILE* *FROM-TIME* *TO-TIME*


# DESCRIPTION

Copy all objects that were valid at the given *TIME* or in the time period
between *FROM-TIME* (inclusive) and *TO-TIME* (not inclusive) from the input
file into the output file.  If no time is given, the current time is used.

Usually the *INPUT-FILE* will be an OSM data file with history. If both
*FROM-TIME* and *TO-TIME* are given, the result will also have history data,
it will also include deleted versions of objects.

If only a single point in time was given, the result will be a normal OSM file
without history containing no deleted objects.

The format for the timestamps is "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ".

This commands reads its input file only once and writes its output file
in one go so it can be streamed, ie. it can read from STDIN and write to
STDOUT.
