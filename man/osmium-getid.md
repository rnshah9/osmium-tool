# NAME

osmium-getid - get objects from OSM file by ID


# SYNOPSIS

**osmium getid** \[*OPTIONS*\] *OSM-FILE* *ID*...\
**osmium getid** \[*OPTIONS*\] *OSM-FILE* -i *ID-FILE*\
**osmium getid** \[*OPTIONS*\] *OSM-FILE* -I *ID-OSM-FILE*


# DESCRIPTION

Get objects with the given IDs from the input and write them to the output.

IDs can be given on the command line (first case in synopsis), or read from
text files with one ID per line (second case in synopsis), or read from
OSM files (third cases in synopsis). A mixture of these cases is also allowed.

All objects with these IDs will be read from *OSM-FILE* and written to the
output. If the option **\--add-referenced/-r** is used all objects
referenced from those objects will also be added to the output.

Objects will be written out in the order they are found in the *OSM-FILE*.

If the option **\--add-referenced/-r** is *not* used, the input file is
read only once, if it is used, the input file will possibly be read up to
three times.

On the command line or in the ID file, the IDs have the form: *TYPE-LETTER*
*NUMBER*. The type letter is 'n' for nodes, 'w' for ways, and 'r' for
relations. If there is no type letter, 'n' for nodes is assumed (or whatever
the **\--default-type** option says). So "n13 w22 17 r21" will match the nodes
13 and 17, the way 22 and the relation 21.

The order in which the IDs appear does not matter. Identical IDs can appear
multiple times on the command line or in the ID file(s).

On the command line, the list of IDs can be in separate arguments or in a
single argument separated by spaces, tabs, commas (,), semicolons (;), forward
slashes (/) or pipe characters (|).

In an ID file (option **\--id-file/-i**) each line must start with an ID in
the format described above. Leading space characters in the line are ignored.
Lines can optionally contain a space character or a hash sign ('#') after the
ID. Any characters after that are ignored. (This also allows files in OPL
format to be read.) Empty lines are ignored.

Note that all objects will be taken from the *OSM-FILE*, the *ID-OSM-FILE* is
only used to detect which objects to get. This might matter if there are
different object versions in the different files.

The *OSM-FILE* can not be a history file unless the **\--with-history/-H**
option is used. Then all versions of the objects will be copied to the output.

If referenced objects are missing from the input file, the type and IDs
of those objects is written out to STDERR at the end of the program unless
the **\--with-history/-H** option was given.

This command will not work with negative IDs.


# OPTIONS

\--default-type=TYPE
:   Use TYPE ('node', 'way', or 'relation') for IDs without a type prefix
    (default: 'node'). It is also allowed to just use the first character
    of the type here.

\--history
:   Deprecated. Use **\--with-history/-H** instead.

-H, \--with-history
:   Make this program work on history files. This is only needed when using
    the **-r** option.

-i, \--id-file[=FILE]
:   Read IDs from text file instead of from the command line. Use the special
    name "-" to read from *STDIN*. Each line of the file must start with an
    ID in the format described above. Lines can optionally contain a space
    character or a hash sign ('#') after the ID. This character and all
    following characters are ignored. (This allows files in OPL format to be
    read.) Empty lines are also ignored. This option can be used multiple
    times.

-I, \--id-osm-file=OSMFILE
:   Like **\--id-file/-i** but get the IDs from an OSM file. This option can be
    used multiple times.

-r, \--add-referenced
:   Recursively find all objects referenced by the objects of the given IDs
    and include them in the output. This only works correctly on non-history
    files unless the `-H` option is also used.

-t, \--remove-tags
:   Remove tags from objects that are not explicitly requested but are only
    included to complete references (nodes in ways and members of relations).
    If an object is both requested and used as a reference it will keep its
    tags. You also need **\--add-referenced/-r** for this to make sense.

\--verbose-ids
:   Also print all requested and missing IDs. This is usually disabled, because
    the lists can get quite long. (This option implies **\--verbose**.)

# DIAGNOSTICS

**osmium getid** exits with exit code

0
  ~ if all IDs were found

1
  ~ if there was an error processing the data or not all IDs were found,
    (this is only detected if the **\--with-history/-H** option was not
    used),

2
  ~ if there was a problem with the command line arguments.


# MEMORY USAGE

**osmium getid** does all its work on the fly and only keeps a table of all
IDs it needs in main memory.


# EXAMPLES

Output nodes 17 and 1234, way 42, and relation 111 to STDOUT in OPL format:

    osmium getid -f opl planet.osm.pbf n1234 w42 n17 r111
